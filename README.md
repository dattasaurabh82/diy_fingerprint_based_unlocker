## How It Works

The device acts as a USB keyboard. When it recognizes your fingerprint, it sends the exact keystrokes to lock your Mac, wake the login screen, and type your password — all in under 7 seconds.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Device
    participant Mac

    User->>Device: Touch sensor
    Device->>Device: Capture + match fingerprint
    Device->>Mac: Ctrl+Cmd+Q (lock screen)
    Note over Mac: Screen locks
    Device->>Mac: LEFT_CTRL x2 (wake display)
    Note over Mac: Password field appears
    Device->>Mac: Cmd+A (clear field)
    Device->>Mac: Type password + Enter
    Note over Mac: Unlocked
```

> **Why LEFT_CTRL for wake?** It's a non-printable modifier key — wakes the display without typing any character into the password field. Space or regular keys would insert unwanted text.

## Hardware

| Component | Model | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **MCU** | [Waveshare RP2350-Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-zero.htm) | USB-C, RP2350A dual-core, 4MB flash |
| **Sensor** | [DFRobot SEN0348](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Capacitive_Fingerprint_Sensor_SKU_SEN0348) | Capacitive fingerprint, UART, 80-slot storage |
| **Switch** | Any SPDT toggle | Selects REGISTER vs RECOGNIZE mode |

### Why These Parts?

The **RP2350-Zero** was chosen for its native USB HID support via the Pico SDK — it appears as a standard keyboard to any OS with zero driver installation. The **SEN0348** is a standalone capacitive sensor with onboard processing and an RGB LED ring, so the MCU just sends UART commands and the sensor handles all biometric computation internally.

```

All modules are **header-only** (`.h` with `inline` functions) — no separate `.cpp` files. This keeps the Arduino IDE happy with a flat sketch structure.

### Two-Slot Alternating Registration

The sensor has 80 fingerprint slots. We use exactly **two** (slot 1 and slot 2) in an alternating pattern to ensure atomic registration safety:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start Registration] --> B{Current active slot?}
    B -->|Slot 1| C[Enroll NEW fingerprint → Slot 2]
    B -->|Slot 2| D[Enroll NEW fingerprint → Slot 1]
    B -->|Virgin| E[Enroll → Slot 1]
    C --> F[Collect password via Serial]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Confirm password]
    G --> H[Write EEPROM: magic + slot + password + checksum]
    H --> I{EEPROM verify OK?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Delete OLD slot — safe now]
    I -->|No| K[Rollback: delete staging slot, restore old EEPROM]
    J --> L[Done — new slot is active]
    K --> M[Old registration still works]

    style J fill:#2d6a4f,color:#fff
    style K fill:#9b2226,color:#fff
    style L fill:#2d6a4f,color:#fff
    style M fill:#9b2226,color:#fff
```

**Why?** If we deleted the old fingerprint first and something fails mid-registration (timeout, bad password, power loss), the old fingerprint is gone forever — the sensor doesn't expose raw templates for backup. By enrolling to the *other* slot first, the old registration stays intact until the entire atomic commit succeeds.

### EEPROM Layout

```
Address  Size   Contents
──────────────────────────────────────
0x00     1      Magic byte (0xAE = encrypted format)
0x01     1      Active slot ID (1 or 2)
0x02     1      Password length (1–32, plaintext)
0x03     32     Password (AES-256-CBC encrypted)
0x23     1      XOR checksum (bytes 0x00–0x22)
──────────────────────────────────────
Total: 36 bytes of 4096 available
```

The password is encrypted at rest using a device-bound key derived from the RP2350's unique hardware ID. The checksum validates the encrypted data's integrity before decryption is attempted.

### Boot Validation Matrix

| EEPROM | Sensor | Result | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Valid + checksum OK | Active slot has fingerprint | **VALID** | Normal operation, clean orphan staging slot |
| Invalid / missing | No fingerprints | **VIRGIN** | Force REGISTER mode |
| Valid | Active slot fingerprint **missing** | **CORRUPT** | Clear all, force REGISTER |
| Invalid | Fingerprint(s) exist | **CORRUPT** | Delete orphans, force REGISTER |

## Serial Protocol

All serial output uses structured `[TAG] message` format, parsed by the [Web Serial Monitor](https://dattasaurabh82.github.io/diy_fingerprint_based_unlocker/):

```
[BOOT]    Startup and validation messages
[SWITCH]  Mode switch changes
[MODE]    Current operating mode
[REG]     Registration flow
[AUTH]    Recognition / authentication
[HID]     HID keystroke actions

## Security

### Threat Model

This device is a **convenience tool** with defense-in-depth. The password is encrypted at rest using AES-256-CBC with a key unique to each physical board. The fingerprint templates live on the sensor's internal flash and are not exportable.

### What's Protected

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Power loss mid-registration | Two-slot alternating — old registration untouched |
| Switch flip mid-enrollment | Abort detected, staging slot deleted, old preserved |
| Serial disconnect during password | 30s timeout → rollback |
| Password confirm mismatch | 3 retries then rollback |
| EEPROM write corruption | Post-write verify → rollback + restore old data |
| Orphan fingerprints after crash | Boot validation cleans orphan staging slots |
| Wrong finger in RECOGNIZE | `search()` returns no match → red LED, no HID |
| Rapid touches | 5s cooldown between unlock sequences |
| No registration in RECOGNIZE | Solid red LED, ignores all touches |
| Orphan slot guard | Match must equal EEPROM active slot, not any enrolled print |

### What's NOT Protected

| Threat | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Physical access to MCU + unique ID extraction | Theoretically recoverable with advanced tooling |
| USB sniffing | HID keystrokes are unencrypted USB |
| Shoulder surfing Serial Monitor | Password masked with `*`, but raw bytes in transit |
| Sensor spoofing | Capacitive sensor has basic anti-spoof, but no liveness detection |

### Password Handling

The password is encrypted at rest in EEPROM and only exists in plaintext RAM during two brief moments: registration (input + confirm + encrypt) and recognition (decrypt → `Keyboard.print()`). In both cases, all buffers — including intermediates and crypto contexts — are zeroed with `memset()` immediately after use.

## Troubleshooting (Setup & Build)

> For usage troubleshooting (day-to-day operation, Web Serial Monitor issues), see [USAGE.md → Troubleshooting](USAGE.md#troubleshooting).

<details>
<summary><strong>Serial Monitor shows nothing after upload</strong></summary>

The RP2350-Zero enumerates as a composite USB device (CDC + HID). After upload, the port name may change. Go to **Tools → Port** and re-select the new port.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sensor init fails on boot</strong></summary>

Check wiring: TX→RX and RX→TX (crossover). Ensure both VCC and VIN on the sensor are connected to 3V3. The LED ring will be solid red if init fails.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>HID types wrong characters</strong></summary>

The `Keyboard.print()` function uses US keyboard layout by default. If your Mac is set to a different layout, special characters may be mistyped. Stick to alphanumeric passwords.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Boot says "corrupt" every time</strong></summary>

The `getStatusID()` API is unreliable on some DFRobot_ID809 firmware versions. This project uses `getEnrolledIDList()` instead. If you're still seeing issues, ensure you have the latest version of this code and the DFRobot_ID809 library.

</details>

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] 🟠 Improve documentation images + Add hardware and 3D print enclosure info  
- [ ] Multi-finger support (different fingers → different actions)
- [ ] Windows/Linux HID sequences
